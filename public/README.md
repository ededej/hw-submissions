1. Registration for users
Pranzo will allow users to register to make it easy for them to find their personal preferences. The user will be identify by their email address and password, which the user chooses when signing up. Each account will use the email as the key so one email will be associated to one user. After sign up, the user will be able to enter their personal page.

2. Registration for restaurants
Each restaurant will be able to register and update the prices for their lunch specials and edit them. The restaurants will have the same authentication with email and password. Each account will use the email as the key so one email will be associated to one user. After sign up, the restaurants will be able to enter their personal page.

3. View preferences/suggestions
Each user will be able to have a personal page where it will show places that they like to go for lunch. Places that we will suggest based on their diet and price preferences. Using a d3.js Zoomable Partition Layout I will display what the user wants to display and zoom their choices to choose the restaurants. After choosing the restaurants I will zoom to their menu so it will be easy for the user to read it.

4. Find Lunch
This is our first page that any user will interact with when they first interact with our website. They can search for lunch by inserting the zip code or the address they want to search for. They can also choose the type of food, diet and price to make their search easier.
